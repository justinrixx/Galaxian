# Galaxian
## A primitive clone of Galaxian
Be warned this is NOT finished or anything. I just put the code up here so I can keep track of it better.

The story is that for one of my lower level CS classes I built Asteroids in C++ with OpenGL/GLUT, and I wanted
to use the same framework to make a Galaxian clone. It's not that great, but it is kinda cool. I haven't touched
this code in a while, so be warned. But It's a fun concept.

Feel free to fork and make into your own project.
